Hello my friends today I am sharing the recipe of Pizza. Pizza is very tasty and crispy.  And among the number of food, Pizza is my favourite food because it tastes and smells fabulous. The pizza itself looks so yummy, crispy and so cheesy. And nearly any ingredient can be put on pizza. The other amazing thing about pizza is that it's delicious no matter what time of day you eat it. You can eat pizza for lunch, dinner, as a midnight meal, as a hungover breakfast, or even as a giant snack when you're really feeling hungry.
